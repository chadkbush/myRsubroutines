myRsubroutines
==============

My first repository on github... I want to keep up with various personal user-defined functions written in R. Some of these functions do things that are already part of the standard core packages that come with an R installation, but I wanted to rewrite them to perform operations in a specific way. 

About me: I'm a physician-in-training at Tulane School of Medicine in New Orleans. I'm currently taking a year off between the 3rd and 4th years of medical school to pursue a masters degree in biostatistics. I have a 5-year-old pit bull terrier mix who is my soul. I'm interested in learning and using R, Perl, PHP, and SQL.
